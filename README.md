# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this new Analysis was to show the fare amounts by city type. For this analysis there were three city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. we calculated the average fare price based on the amount of drivers and the amount of rides given in each city type and then plotted the data to show the results neatly. The graph can be seen in the analysis folder.
## Results
Based on the dates given we calculated the Fares by each city type. We see that the highest city type based on fares was Urban. this is because there is a higher quantity of rides and drivers in this type. Although the average fare price was less than the other two city types the sure quantity of rides made up for this fact. The highest average fare price was rural but the quantity of rides was the lowest. In the middle was suburban. Suburbans had an average fare price between that of Urban and Rural. 
## Summary
Based on the results of this analysis PyBer should focus on Urban areas as they are the most proffitable. because of the average fare price in suburban cities is large this area should not be neglected but PyBer should limit the amount of drivers in this area. Same thing goes for Rural cities but have even less drivers than suburban cities. Overall, the main focus for drivers should be in Urban cities as they are the most profitable.
